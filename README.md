# What is the Travelling Salesmen Problem?

### I. Functionality Implementation
1. Implemented the **Ant Colony System** algorithm.
2. Implemented the dynamic search process and visualization of results for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) using the **Ant Colony System** (ACS) algorithm.


### V. Code Explanation
1. **Ant Colony System**
    - The core algorithm is an enhanced Ant Colony Optimization algorithm, ACS.
    - ACS is a probabilistic algorithm used to find optimized paths. It was introduced by Marco Dorigo in 1992, inspired by ants' behavior in finding food.
    - In 1997, Dorigo optimized ACS with a new parallel computing approach.

### VI. After Certain Improvements, Applicable Scenarios
1. Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
2. Job-shop Scheduling Problem
3. Vehicle Routing Problem
4. Graph
